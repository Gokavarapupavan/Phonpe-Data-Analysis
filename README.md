## Power BI Dashboard: **PhonePe Pulse Dataset Analysis**

This project involves the analysis and visualization of the PhonePe Pulse dataset using **Power BI**. The PhonePe Pulse dataset contains detailed information on transactions, geographical distribution, and merchant details from PhonePe's mobile payment platform across India. The goal of this project is to leverage the dataset to create insightful visualizations that highlight key trends and patterns in digital payment behavior across different states, cities, and time periods.

### Key Features:

* **Transaction Trends**: Visualizing the growth and seasonal trends of transactions over time.
* **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping transaction data to reveal insights about regional payment preferences and the distribution of users and merchants.
* **Payment Modes Breakdown**: Analyzing the breakdown of payment modes, including UPI, wallets, and others, and understanding how they vary across different regions.
* **Merchant Insights**: Gaining insights into merchant performance, including transaction volumes, category-based analysis, and more.
* **Time-Based Patterns**: Analyzing transaction volumes by time of day, day of the week, and month to identify peak periods for transactions.

### Key Visualizations:

* **Heatmap**: Showing transaction volumes across different states and cities.
* **Bar Charts and Line Graphs**: Demonstrating the growth trends in transaction values and volumes.
* **Geographical Distribution**: Using maps to represent the number of transactions or users in different regions of India.
* **KPI Indicators**: Displaying important metrics like total transactions, user growth, and payment mode distribution.

### Technologies Used:

* **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards, visualizations, and reporting.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For building calculated columns, measures, and custom aggregations to enhance the analysis.
* **Power Query**: For data transformation and preparation.

### Purpose:

The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights into India's digital payment ecosystem, empowering businesses, policymakers, and analysts to understand trends in mobile payments, user behavior, and regional preferences. The dashboard serves as a useful tool for monitoring the adoption of digital payment systems and identifying opportunities for further growth in different regions.
